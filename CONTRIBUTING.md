# How to contribute

This API client is implemented for use at [rrbone](http://www.rrbone.net), so I will only work on the parts we need for our application.
Additional improvements, comments on code and implementation and bug fixes are very welcome.

## Report bugs, improvements or feature requests

* Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
  * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.
* If you need a resource implemented in Ruby, but does not know how to do it
  the right way, just contact me or open an issue. I will try to find time to
  implement any needed things.

## Making Changes

* Fork the repository on GitHub.
* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
* Make commits of logical units.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
* Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format.
* Run _all_ the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.
* Include tests for new features and bug fixes (if you don't know how to do that, feel free to ask, I will help).


## Submitting Changes

* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request to the repository.
* Wait for my response.
